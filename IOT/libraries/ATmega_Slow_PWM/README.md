### Why do we need this [ATmega_Slow_PWM library](https://github.com/khoih-prog/ATmega_Slow_PWM)

### Features

This library enables you to use ISR-based PWM channels on **ATmega164, ATmega324, ATmega644, ATmega1284 using MCUdude MightyCore** to create and output PWM any GPIO pin. Because this library doesn't use the powerful purely hardware-controlled PWM with many limitations, the maximum PWM frequency is currently limited at **500Hz**, which is still suitable for many real-life applications. Now you can also modify PWM settings on-the-fly.

---

This library enables you to use Interrupt from Hardware Timers on AVR-based boards to create and output PWM to pins. It now supports 16 ISR-based synchronized PWM channels, while consuming only 1 Hardware Timer. PWM interval can be very long (uint64_t microsecs / millisecs). The most important feature is they're ISR-based PWM channels. Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions or tasks. This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks. These hardware PWM channels, using interrupt, still work even if other functions are blocking. Moreover, they are much more precise (certainly depending on clock frequency accuracy) than other software PWM using millis() or micros(). That's necessary if you need to measure some data requiring better accuracy.

As **Hardware Timers are rare, and very precious assets** of any board, this library now enables you to use up to **16 ISR-based synchronized PWM channels, while consuming only 1 Hardware Timer**. Timers' interval is very long (**ulong millisecs**).

Now with these new **16 ISR-based PWM-channels**, the maximum interval is **practically unlimited** (limited only by unsigned long miliseconds) while **the accuracy is nearly perfect** compared to software PWM channels. 

The most important feature is they're ISR-based PWM channels. Therefore, their executions are **not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks**. This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks. 

The [**ISR_8_PWMs_Array_Complex**](examples/ISR_8_PWMs_Array_Complex) example will demonstrate the nearly perfect accuracy, compared to software PWM, by printing the actual period / duty-cycle in `microsecs` of each of PWM-channels.

Being ISR-based PWM, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks, such as connecting to WiFi, Internet or Blynk services. You can also have many `(up to 16)` PWM channels to use.

This non-being-blocked important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.

You'll see `software-based` SimpleTimer is blocked while system is connecting to WiFi / Internet / Blynk, as well as by blocking task 
in loop(), using delay() function as an example. The elapsed time then is very unaccurate

---

#### Why using ISR-based PWM is better

Imagine you have a system with a **mission-critical** function, measuring water level and control the sump pump or doing something much more important. You normally use a software timer to poll, or even place the function in loop(). But what if another function is **blocking** the loop() or setup().

So your function **might not be executed, and the result would be disastrous.**

You'd prefer to have your function called, no matter what happening with other functions (busy loop, bug, etc.).

The correct choice is to use a Hardware Timer with **Interrupt** to call your function.

These hardware PWM channels, using interrupt, still work even if other functions are blocking. Moreover, they are much more **precise** (certainly depending on clock frequency accuracy) than other software PWM channels using millis() or micros(). That's necessary if you need to measure some data requiring better accuracy.

Functions using normal software PWM channels, relying on loop() and calling millis(), won't work if the loop() or setup() is blocked by certain operation. For example, certain function is blocking while it's connecting to WiFi or some services.

The catch is **your function is now part of an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine), and must be lean / mean, and follow certain rules.** More to read on:

[**HOWTO Attach Interrupt**](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/external-interrupts/attachinterrupt/)

---

### Currently supported Boards

- **ATmega164(A/P), ATmega324(A/P/PA/PB), ATmega644(A/P), ATmega1284(P)**

### Not yet supported Boards

- **ATmega8535, ATmega16 and ATmega32**

---

#### Important Notes about ISR

1. Inside the attached function, **delay() wonâ€™t work and the value returned by millis() will not increment.** Serial data received while in the function may be lost. You should declare as **volatile any variables that you modify within the attached function.**

2. Typically global variables are used to pass data between an ISR and the main program. To make sure variables shared between an ISR and the main program are updated correctly, declare them as volatile.

---
---

## Installation

### Use Arduino Library Manager

The best and easiest way is to use `Arduino Library Manager`. Search for [**ATmega_Slow_PWM**](https://github.com/khoih-prog/ATmega_Slow_PWM), then select / install the latest version.
You can also use this link [![arduino-library-badge](https://www.ardu-badge.com/badge/ATmega_Slow_PWM.svg?)](https://www.ardu-badge.com/ATmega_Slow_PWM) for more detailed instructions.

### Manual Install

Another way to install is to:

1. Navigate to [**ATmega_Slow_PWM**](https://github.com/khoih-prog/ATmega_Slow_PWM) page.
2. Download the latest release `ATmega_Slow_PWM-master.zip`.
3. Extract the zip file to `ATmega_Slow_PWM-master` directory 
4. Copy whole `ATmega_Slow_PWM-master` folder to Arduino libraries' directory such as `~/Arduino/libraries/`.

### VS Code & PlatformIO

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide)
3. Install [**ATmega_Slow_PWM** library](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/khoih-prog/ATmega_Slow_PWM) by using [Library Manager](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/khoih-prog/ATmega_Slow_PWM/installation). Search for **ATmega_Slow_PWM** in [Platform.io Author's Libraries](https://platformio.org/lib/search?query=author:%22Khoi%20Hoang%22)
4. Use included [platformio.ini](platformio/platformio.ini) file from examples to ensure that all dependent libraries will installed automatically. Please visit documentation for the other options and examples at [Project Configuration File](https://docs.platformio.org/page/projectconf.html)

### HOWTO Fix `Multiple Definitions` Linker Error

The current library implementation, using `xyz-Impl.h` instead of standard `xyz.cpp`, possibly creates certain `Multiple Definitions` Linker error in certain use cases.

You can include this `.hpp` file

```
// Can be included as many times as necessary, without `Multiple Definitions` Linker Error
#include "ATmega_Slow_PWM.hpp"      //https://github.com/khoih-prog/ATmega_Slow_PWM
```

in many files. But be sure to use the following `.h` file **in just 1 `.h`, `.cpp` or `.ino` file**, which must **not be included in any other file**, to avoid `Multiple Definitions` Linker Error

```
// To be included only in main(), .ino with setup() to avoid `Multiple Definitions` Linker Error
#include "ATmega_Slow_PWM.h"        //https://github.com/khoih-prog/ATmega_Slow_PWM
```

Check the new [**multiFileProject** example](examples/multiFileProject) for a `HOWTO` demo.

Have a look at the discussion in [Different behaviour using the src_cpp or src_h lib #80](https://github.com/khoih-prog/ESPAsync_WiFiManager/discussions/80)

## More useful Information

From [Arduino 101: Timers and Interrupts](https://www.robotshop.com/community/forum/t/arduino-101-timers-and-interrupts/13072)

### 1. Timer0:

Timer0 is a 8-bit timer.

In the Arduino world, **Timer0 is been used for the timer functions**, like delay(), millis() and micros(). If you change **Timer0** registers, this may influence the Arduino timer function. So you should know what you are doing.

### 2. Timer1:

**Timer1** is a 16-bit timer. In the Arduino world, the Servo library uses **Timer1**

### 3. Timer2:

**Timer2** is a 8-bit timer like **Timer0**

In the Arduino world, the **tone() function uses Timer2**.

### 4. Timer3 and Timer4:

**Timer3** is only available on Arduino **ATMEGA_1284(P), ATMEGA_324PB boards**

**Timer4** is only available on Arduino **ATMEGA_324PB boards**

### 5. Important Notes

Before using any Timer, you have to make sure the **Timer has not been used by any other purpose**

- **Timer1 and Timer2 are supported for ATmega164(A/P), ATmega324(A/P/PA), ATmega644(A/P)**

- **Timer1, Timer2 and Timer3 are supported for ATmega1284(P)**

- **Timer1, Timer2, Timer3 and Timer4 are supported for ATmega324PB, which is not yet supported by MightyCore v2.1.3**

## Usage


Before using any Timer, you have to make sure the Timer has not been used by any other purpose.


#### 1. Init Hardware Timer

```
// Select the timers you're using, here ITimer1
#define USE_TIMER_1     true
#define USE_TIMER_2     false
#define USE_TIMER_3     false
#define USE_TIMER_4     false

// Init ATmega_Slow_PWM, each can service 16 different ISR-based PWM channels
ATmega_Slow_PWM ISR_PWM;
```

#### 2. Set PWM Frequency, dutycycle, attach irqCallbackStartFunc and irqCallbackStopFunc functions

```
void irqCallbackStartFunc()
{

}

void irqCallbackStopFunc()
{

}

void setup()
{
  ....
  
  // You can use this with PWM_Freq in Hz
  ISR_PWM.setPWM(PWM_Pin, PWM_Freq, PWM_DutyCycle, irqCallbackStartFunc, irqCallbackStopFunc);
                   
  ....                 
}  
```

---
---


### Debug

Debug is enabled by default on Serial.

You can also change the debugging level `_PWM_LOGLEVEL_` from 0 to 4

```cpp
// Don't define _PWM_LOGLEVEL_ > 0. Only for special ISR debugging only. Can hang the system.
#define _PWM_LOGLEVEL_     0
```

---

### Troubleshooting

If you get compilation errors, more often than not, you may need to install a newer version of the core for Arduino boards.

Sometimes, the library will only work if you update the board core to the latest version because I am using newly added functions.
